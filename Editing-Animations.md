### Editing SVG
I have tried to keep the SVG code as readable as possible, so you should be able
to do quite a lot of editing from a text editor.

- If you've never touched SVG code or CSS animation before, I recommend that you
check out my [_Draw with Code_ zine](https://solarpunk.cool/zines/draw-with-code/index.html)
for a overview and step-by-step tutorial.

- You can use a simple text editor but I recommend using an IDE like Atom,
Brackets or VS Code, with an SVG Preview plugin.
More info and links to these editors & plugins can be found in the
[tools page](https://solarpunk.cool/zines/draw-with-code/tools.html) of the zine.

- Every element in every animation either has its own `id`, or is in a `<g>` (group)
with an `id`. If you're still not sure which part of the image the code refers to,
try commenting it out (Select it, then use the shortcut **Ctrl + \** in Atom).
If the right thing disappears, great!

- You can move things around by editing their `x` & `y` attributes directly or you
can apply different types of `transform` to elements or groups of elements.
But just a word of warning: if you're changing/adding transforms, you may need to
adjust that element's `style="transform-origin:[x]px [y]px [z]px;"` value, or it
will scale / rotate from the wrong place.

- If the animation is distracting you while you're trying to make other changes,
you can comment out the CSS animation (look for `@keyframes` rulesets in
`<style>`), or the `<script>` section if it's an anime.js animation. In practice,
that `<script>` section is huge, so I usually don't comment it all out while I'm
working- I just change `<script>` to `script>` (delete the opening `<` character)
to make the whole thing invalid. Replace it again and your animation comes back
to life.

- You can also edit SVG in a graphical editor like [Inkscape](inkscape.org) or
Illustrator. But there may be some snags along the way - see the
[_Making Static Images_](./making-static-images.md) document for more info.



### Editing CSS
CSS animations are contained within the `<style>` section near the top of the SVG,
they look like this:

```css
#request { animation: slide-request 20s linear infinite; }
@keyframes slide-request {
  0%, 12% { transform: translateX(6px); }
  14% { transform: translateX(0); }
}

#port-arrow { animation: fade-port-arrow 20s linear infinite; }
@keyframes fade-port-arrow {
  0%, 16% { opacity: 0; transform: scaleX(0); }
  17% { opacity: 1; }
  22%, 100% { transform: scaleX(1); opacity: 1; }
}
```

What's going on? let's break it down:

```css
#request {  /* select the element with an id of 'request' and apply these rules: */
  animation: slide-request 20s linear infinite;
    /* 'animation' is actually a shorthand form for all of these rules: ‚Üì*/
  animation-name: slide-request;  /* do whatever '@keyframes slide request' says */
  animation-duration: 20s;  /* take 20s to do it */
  animation-timing-function: linear;  /* don't use an easing function */
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;  /* loop forever */
 }
```
_**TODO:** finish explanation of CSS animation_

### Editing anime.js
For animations made with [anime.js](animejs.com), you'll see two sections of code within the `<script>` section of the SVG. The first part looks like this, but goes on much, much longer:

```javascript
!function(n,e){"object"==typeof exports&&"undefined"!=typeof module?
module.exports=e():"function"==typeof define&&define.amd?define(e)
:n.anime=e()}(this,function(){"use strict";var n={update:null,begin:
null,loopBegin:null,changeBegin:null,change:null,changeComplete:null,
loopComplete:null,complete:null,loop:1,direction:"normal",autoplay:
!0,timelineOffset:0},e={duration:1e3,delay:0,endDelay:0}...});
```

:grimacing:

Don't worry, you don't have to touch this - that's the anime.js javascript library, minified (squished to the point of being unreadable) to make the filesize smaller.
After that solid block of gibberish, you'll find the animation timeline that I've written. It will look something like this:

```javascript
const tl = anime.timeline({
  autoplay: true,
  loop: true,
  duration: 500,
  easing: 'easeInOutQuad'
})
tl
  .add({
    targets: ['#a', '#b', '#c'],
    opacity: [0, 1],
    delay: anime.stagger(600),
    duration: 1200
  }, 1000)
  .add({
    targets: '#arrow',
    scale: [0, 1],
  }, '-=250')
  .add({
    targets: '#label-pƒÅtaka',
    opacity: [0, 1],
    easing: 'linear'
    duration: 1000
  }, '+=400')
```

This is an anime.js timeline, and it's what you should be editing. It may look complicated, but it's less so than CSS animation, and very flexible once you get used to it. You can check out the [documentation](https://animejs.com/documentation/) for more specifics, but let's break it down:

```javascript
const tl = anime.timeline({ // 'tl' is an anime timeline object.
  autoplay: true,           // it will play as soon as the page loads.
  loop: true,               // it will loop once it is finished.
  duration: 500,            // each step will last 500ms (unless stated otherwise).
  easing: 'easeInOutQuad'   // each step will animate slowly at the start,
                            // then quickly, then slowly again at the end.
})                          // end of the definition of 'tl'.
```

_(see [`easeInOutQuad`](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad) and other easings visualized on [easings.net](https://easings.net/))_

```javascript
tl                              // take the 'tl' timeline object
  .add({                        // and add this to it:
    targets: ['#a', '#b', '#c'],// an animation targeting the elements with an
                                // id(#) of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
    opacity: [0, 1],            // transitioning their opacity from 0 to 1
                                // (fading them in).
    delay: anime.stagger(500),  // stagger their fade-ins: #b will start 500ms
                                // after #a starts, then #c 500ms later.
    duration: 750               // each fade-in will last 750ms (this statement
                                // overrides the default duration of 500 from 'tl').
  }, 500)                       // delay! this whole section will start at 500ms
                                // (this is an absolute time point, not relative)
```

So the timing so far is:

```javascript
0: 'tl' starts

500: '#a' starts its fade-in

1000: '#b' starts its fade-in
1250: '#a' finishes
1500: '#c' starts its fade-in
1750: '#b' finishes

2250: '#c' finishes
```

ok, next section:

```javascript
.add({                // add this to the timeline:
  targets: '#arrow',  // an animation targeting the element with an
                      // id of 'arrow'.
  scale: [0, 1],      // grow the element from a scale of 0% to 100%
                      // (a scale of 0 means the element is not visible)
}, '-=250')           // relative, negative delay! this section will start 250ms
                      // *before* the previous part of the timeline ends.
```

That relative, negative delay means that the arrow will start growing _before_ the previous animation is entirely finished:

```javascript
1750: '#b' finishes
2000: '#arrow' starts scaling up
2250: '#c' finishes
2500: '#arrow' finishes
```

Note that because `tl` set the default duration as `500`, and we didn't specify otherwise, `#arrow` will take 500ms to animate on.
Last section:

```javascript
.add({                      // add this to the timeline:
  targets: '#label-pƒÅtaka', // an animation targeting the element with an
                            // id of 'label-pƒÅtaka'.
  opacity: [0, 1],          // fade it in from 0% to 100%.
  easing: 'linear'          // use a 'linear' easing, not 'easeInOutQuad'
  duration: 750             // take 750ms, not 500ms
}, '+=500')                 // relative delay! this section will start 500ms
                            // *after* the previous part of the timeline ends.
```

The relative delay means that the label will start fading in 500ms _after_ the previous animations are finished:

```javascript
2000: '#arrow' starts scaling up
2250: '#c' finishes
2500: '#arrow' finishes

3000: '#label-pƒÅtaka' starts fading in


3750: '#label-pƒÅtaka' finishes
```

Those relative delays are super-helpful when you want to make timing changes to a timeline. In a complex CSS animation, you would have to adjust EVERY! SINGLE! CHANGE! from that point on. :weary:
With anime.js, if you're using relative delays, everything just slides to a new point in time, maintaining the sequence with the animations around it. So you can delete sections or add new ones, and the rest of the timeline will be OK.
Have a play around with the animations, and check out the [anime.js documentation](https://animejs.com/documentation/) if anything doesn't make sense.


### Editing video
You'll find the high-quality screen recordings of these animations in the `üìÅÔ∏è mp4` folder. You can import these into the video editing tool of your choice, mix them with footage as you like, and export new videos.
